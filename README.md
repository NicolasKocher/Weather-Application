# Weather Application

This project is a weather application built with React, providing real-time weather data for any location. It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather details.
It is my first React Project and also my first time working with an API.

## Features

- Search and display weather information by geoLocation (latitude and longitude).
- Show details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather forecast for the next 5 days.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
- Updates frequently

## Demo

You can see a demo of the application here:
